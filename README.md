# GuessMaster
Final Project for an intro to Python class

The game is similar to hangman, except rather than slowly hanging a stick figure as you incorrectly guess, the Block P (Purdue Universities Logo), slowly falls apart. This project was made to combine the basic uses of the python language and show a moderate level of proficiency at the basics.

The game includes a simple GUI made using the graphics library and multiple features that I developed on my own.

It contains many errors, PEP08 issues, and frankly an incredible amount of spaghetti code. It's truly mind-boggling that the program runs correctly. In the coming months I plan on updating the project to be considerably cleaner and readable. I wanted to include this raw version of the game we submitted as a testament and example to how much I have grown as a developer.

Thank you for playing and checking it out if you did.
